## Research Project Task Distribution Plan | Dr. Ram Kumar, January 2025


## üîç Project Overview

This collaborative research project focuses on developing sophisticated models that analyze vocal cues‚Äîincluding pitch, tone, and speech rate‚Äîto accurately detect and classify human emotions. Using advanced libraries like Librosa and PyDub, our interdisciplinary team will explore the intricate relationship between paralinguistic features and emotional states.
